Tutorial on the Go programming language and applying that to the cyber and hacker world
```

# Intro 


This tutorial mainly will introduce you to the go programming language, I will be talking about how to use Go to you're advantage in this field, using it to build things like OSINT tools, Vulnerability scanners, fuzzers, engines, brute forcing utilities and much much more. Like most of my tutorials ( Perl for cyber weapons development, Fortran notes, and others alike ) this tutorial will be updated every week or ever few days. Please note that i will not be going over the basics of the go programming language, this follows for all of the following topics - `functions, print statements, some standard packages, fmt, types, data structures, maps, variable lists, import lists, constant lists, calling functions, variables, etc` if you need information about a certian thing or need more guidence of the go programming language i highly suggest you look at this web source
